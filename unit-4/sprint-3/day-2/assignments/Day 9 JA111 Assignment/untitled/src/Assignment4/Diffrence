Q.Explain the difference between overloading and overriding methods with an example?

Overloading:-
  Two or more methods may have the same name if they differ in parameters (different number of parameters, different types of parameters, or both). These methods are called overloaded methods
   and this feature is called method overloading.

   Examples:-

        class MethodOverloading {
            private static void display(int a){
                System.out.println("Arguments: " + a);
            }

            private static void display(int a, int b){
                System.out.println("Arguments: " + a + " and " + b);
            }

            public static void main(String[] args) {
                display(1);
                display(1, 4);
            }
        }



Overriding:-
           we have defined the run method in the subclass as defined in the parent class but it has some specific implementation. The name and parameter of the method are the same,
            and there is IS-A relationship between the classes, so there is method overriding.





          examples:-
          class Parent {
              void show()
              {
                  System.out.println("Parent's show()");
              }
          }

          // Inherited class
          class Child extends Parent {
              // This method overrides show() of Parent
              @Override
              void show()
              {
                  System.out.println("Child's show()");
              }
          }
          class Main {
              public static void main(String[] args)
              {
                  Parent obj1 = new Parent();
                  obj1.show();


                  Parent obj2 = new Child();
                  obj2.show();
              }
          }
