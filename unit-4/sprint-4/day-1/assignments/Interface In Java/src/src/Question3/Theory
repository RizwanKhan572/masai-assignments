Abstract:-
         1.Abstract class can have Abstract and non abstract method.
         2.Abstract class does,t support multiple inheritance.
         3.Abstract class have final ,non-final ,static and non-static variables.
         4.Abstract class can have Implementation with interface.
         5.The abstract class have a keyword to use declare abstract class
         ex:- abstract class Animal{}

         6.An abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces.
         7.A Java abstract class can have class members like private, protected, etc.
         Examples:-
                    public abstract class Shape{
                    public abstract void draw();
                    }

Interface:-
            1.Interface can have only abstract methods. Since Java 8, it can have default and static methods
            2.Interface supports multiple inheritance.
            3.Interface has only static and final variables.
            4.Interface can't provide the implementation of abstract class.
            5.The interface keyword is used to declare interface.
            6.An interface can extend another Java interface only.
            7.Members of a Java interface are public by default.

            Examples:-

                      public interface Drawable{
                      void draw();
                      }
