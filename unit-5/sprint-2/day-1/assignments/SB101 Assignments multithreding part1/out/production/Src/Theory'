Q1) What do you mean by Multithreading? Why is it important?
   Multithreading refers to a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously for maximum utilization of the CPU.
   Multithreading and Multiprocessing are used for multitasking in Java, but we prefer multithreading over multiprocessing.
   This is because the threads use a shared memory area which helps to save memory,
    and also, the content-switching between the threads is a bit faster than the process.


Q2) What are the benefits of using Multithreading?
   Multithreading saves time as you can perform multiple operations together.
   The threads are independent, so it does not block the user to perform multiple operations at the same time and also,
   if an exception occurs in a single thread, it does not affect other threads.


Q3) Differentiate between process and thread.
