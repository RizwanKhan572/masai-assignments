Q1/ What is the difference between a synchronized method and a synchronized block?

Synchronized block:-
                    Synchronized block can be used to perform synchronization on any specific resource of the method.
                    Suppose we have 50 lines of code in our method, but we want to synchronize only 5 lines, in such cases, we can use synchronized block.
                    If we put all the codes of the method in the synchronized block, it will work same as the synchronized method.


Synchronized Method:-
                    Synchronization in Java is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource.
                    Java Synchronization is better option where we want to allow only one thread to access the shared resource.
