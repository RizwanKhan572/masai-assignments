    Database relationship means how the data in one table is related to the data in another table. 
   In RDBMS (Relational Database Management System). The term “Relational” refers to the tables with Relations.
 Relationships between two tables are created using keys. A key in one table will normally relate to a key in another table.
 Two tables in a database may also be unrelated. There are mainly 3 types of database relationships:

1. One-to-one Relationship: If only one piece of data in one table relates to only one piece of data
   In another table, it is known as a one-to-one  relationship.
2. One-to-many  Relationship: If only one piece of data in one table relates to the multiple data
    In another table, it is known as the one-to-many elationship.
3. Many-to-many  Relationship: If multiple data in one table relate to multiple data in another table
   It is known as a many-to-many relationship.


 One-to-One Database Relationship I with examples. 
Now we will create the database school and within the school database, we will create two tables i.e.
 Students and Employees, Then we will see the One-To-One Relationship between Students and Employees table.
   


create table student(
id int primary key, Name char(24) Not Null,
class int,
age int);


  mysql> select * from student; 
+------+-------+-------+------+                       
| id   | Name  | class | age  |
+------+-------+-------+------+
|    1 | sandy  |     6|   11 |
|    2 | candy  |     4|   16 |
|    3 | nandu  |    9 |   14 |
|    4 | sahil |     6 |   13 |
+------+-------+-------+------+

 mysql> select * from Employees;

create table Employees(address char(24),
                         id int,
                          addressid int);
                                                  
+----------+------+-----------+
| address  | id   | addressid |
+----------+------+-----------+
| mumbai   | 1001 |         1 |
