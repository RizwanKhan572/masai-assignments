Q1/- What are the limitations of EntityManager methods to perform CRUD operations with
DB?


Operations that modify the content of the database (such as storing new objects) require
 an active transaction. In the example above, every Point object is first constructed as
 an ordinary Java object. It then becomes associated with an EntityManager and with its 
transaction (as a managed entity) by the persist method. The new Point objects are 
physically stored in the database only when the transaction is committed
