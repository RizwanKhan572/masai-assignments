Q4/- What is a Race condition, How will you solve the Race condition,explain with an Examples:-

Java is a multi-threaded programming language and there is a higher risk to occur race conditions.
Because the same resource may be accessed by multiple threads at the same time and may change the data.
 We can say that race condition is a concurrency bug. It is closely related to deadlock in Java. In this section,
 we will implement the race condition in Java.


 Examples:-
 class Counter implements Runnable
 {
 private int c = 0;
 public void increment()
 {
 try
 {
 Thread.sleep(10);
 }
 catch (InterruptedException e)
 {
 //Auto-generated catch block
 e.printStackTrace();
 }
 c++;
 }
 public void decrement()
 {
 c--;
 }
 public int getValue()
 {
 return c;
 }
 @Override
 public void run()
 {
 //incrementing
 this.increment();
 System.out.println("Value for Thread After increment " + Thread.currentThread().getName() + " " + this.getValue());
 //decrementing
 this.decrement();
 System.out.println("Value for Thread at last " + Thread.currentThread().getName() + " " + this.getValue());
 }
 }
 public class RaceConditionDemo
 {
 public static void main(String args[])
 {
 Counter counter = new Counter();
 Thread t1 = new Thread(counter, "Thread-1");
 Thread t2 = new Thread(counter, "Thread-2");
 Thread t3 = new Thread(counter, "Thread-3");
 t1.start();
 t2.start();
 t3.start();
 }
 }
