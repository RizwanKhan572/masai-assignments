Question 1;
1.
== operator:-
  *.  == is the operator
  *.  == operator compare references not value compare.
  *.  == operator check both references point  same location or not.
  *.  == operator can not be overridden.


   Public class DoubleEqual{

     public static void main(String[] args){
         String s1="Ramnarayan";
         String s2=new String ("Ramnarayan");
         String s3="Ramnarayan";
         System.out.println(s1==s2);
         System.out.println(s1==s3);

     }

   }
  Output=
  1.False;
  2.True;




2.
 equals() method:-
   *. equals() is a method of a class.
   *. equals() method is used for content comparison
   *. equals() method compare value of string for equality.

Public class Equalsl{

     public static void main(String[] args){
         String s1="ramnarayan";
         String s2="ramnarayan";
         String s3="RAMNARAYAN";
         String s4=new String("ramnarayan");

         System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));
         System.out.println(s1.equals(s3));
         System.out.println(s1.equals(s4));
     }

   }
  Output=
  1.True
  2.False
  3.True


  Question 2:-

  i) Java Strings are immutable:-
      The  string is immutable means that  we can not change  the current string,but we can change the references of the object.
      The string is immutable it can help security,,concurrency  and class loading.


      Advantage:-
      We can not change the current string and String class is immutable. Once we create a string a object its data can not be modified.
      String immutable is saving memory and giving fast performance with more security.

      Disadvantage:-
      if you modified the string then a new object is created on modification.this is the very costly because this is the large modified object you create.



  Question 3:-

    i) has-A relationship:-
       has-A relationship in java we called as a composition. it is additionally utilized for code not usable in java.
       has-A relationship examples of one of the class has a references  to occasion of another class of similar class.

     code example;-
       class Address{
       int road_no:
       String city;
       String state;
       int pin;

       Address(int rodd_no,String city,String state, int pin){
       this.road_no=road_no;
       this.city=city;
       this.state=state;
       this.pin=pin;
       }
       }
       Class Student{
       String name;
       Address ad;


       }



Question 4:-

    import java.util.Scanner;

    public class Printdata{

    public static void main(String[] args){
      Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
            System.out.println("Enter Your Name:");
            String name=sc.next();

            System.out.println("Enter Your Age:");
            int age=sc.nextInt();

            System.out.println(name+" : "+age );
    }
    }

output:-
Enter Your Name:
Sandeep
Enter Your Age:
20
Sandeep : 20;



Question 5:-

public class Doublearray {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int [] arr={1,2,3,4};
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
            System.out.println(arr[i]*2);
        }
    }
}

output:= 2,4,6,8;
