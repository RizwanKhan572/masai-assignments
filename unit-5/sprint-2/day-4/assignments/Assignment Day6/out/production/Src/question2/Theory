Q2/- Whatâ€™s the difference between class lock and object lock?

Class Lock:-
            If a static method is marked as Synchrnozied
            and called by a Thread, the whole Class will be locked
            until the method execution completed.

Object lock:-
             If a non-static method is marked as
             Synchronzied and called by a Thread, the current instance
             (Object) will be locked util the method execution completed.
